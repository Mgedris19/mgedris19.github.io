# Data Structures final
## Stacks, Linked lists and Trees.
 
Just what are these things?
Well, let's take a look.
 
## A Stack
This is just what it sounds like, a stack of data.
Completely  unorganized data that is just stuck on
top of each other, Figuratively speaking.  
[stack page](stack.md)
 
## A linked list
The easiest way to introduce this is to think
of this as a list that is floating around in
memory somewhere.  The difference is that the
pieces of data are still connected.
[Linked list](Linked_lists.md)
 
## A Tree
In short this is a linked list with a few more steps
to it.  The data is organized off of a single piece
of data.
[Trees](Trees.md)
