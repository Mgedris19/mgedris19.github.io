        <h1>What is 3D modeling</h1>
        <p>
            Well the answer is in the question, making models in three dimensions.  This topic covers a surprisingly
            large area, from the video game industry to helping out in movies.  The Mandolorian is filmed on a green
            screen and then cgi is used in the game engine Unreal to make it look right.  So just how do you go about
            doing it, well the trick is finding a starting point, and thatâ€™s what is here a few things to help you
            get started as a modeler.  These are two of the engines that are used pretty frequently and are very powerful.

        <h3>Why do it?</h3>
        <p>
            The reason that I did it is because it was a way for me to bring my imagintaion to life, so to speak.
            I'm not the best at art and drawing, but what I found I could do is take the drawings that others had done
            and then take it into one of the engines and then build my own.  So if you feel like you want to let your artistic
            side loose but struggle with drawing it worked for me and might for you.  Bellow are some of my creations: 
            a crossbow, a Y-wing from the Star Wars franchise, and then a particle system build I made for a hack week.
