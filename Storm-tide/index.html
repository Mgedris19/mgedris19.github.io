        <h1>What is 3D modeling</h1>
        <p>
            Well the answer is in the question, making models in three dimensions.  This topic covers a surprisingly
             large area, from the video game industry to helping out in movies.  The Mandolorian is filmed on a green
              screen and then cgi is used in the game engine Unreal to make it look right.  So just how do you go about
             doing it, well the trick is finding a starting point, and thatâ€™s what is here a few things to help you
             get started as a modeler.
