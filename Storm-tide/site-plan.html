      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose is to show off the capabilities of the 3D modeling applications Maya and maybe Blender.
        I plan on having some time lapses or a video showing me working on projects alongside building the website.
        I also would like to show the basics of working with particle systems inside of the application.
        This is really just to show the fundamentals and what you can do with them inside of 3D modeling.
    </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>Peoople who want to know more about the subject and what can be done with it.  The topic is very diverse and 
        has a lot of possibilities and can kind of be a rough place to start, hopfully this will be a way for people to
        find a little bit of direction as they begin.  This is primaraly
        an educational website alowing me to show people what is possible.

      <p>
        I'm not sure what to put for this part of the page, but the idea for this page is going to be an over just what 
        the website is about and kind of how to navigate it.  It may just also be a place to show off what I've done.

      <p>
      I'm struggeling with what I want to do with this page, the original plan was to do particles, but I may just make 
      this page a step further page.  The idea of it would be to just say/show what else you can do along with modeling.
