    <p>Basic overview</p>
    <h1>
        I'm building this page for people who would like to learn more about the art of 3D modeling and what you can do with
        it.  As far as things go, if you know what you are doing this is a very powerful tool for a lot of people.  I have 
        a friend who does something similar with modeling but he then uses it for 3D printing, where I use it for the game 
        development side of things.  There is still a lot I don't know, but putting some of what I've learned out there
        I hope I can help a few others out.
        I can see this site having three pages, the first one the home page, the second one being about raw modeling,
        the third page being about particle effects, with a possible fourth page about painting.  I'm not entirely sure
        how realistic this next part is, but I would like to find a way to embed some links, to the websites that I will 
        talk about on my page.  I don't think this is incredibly difficult, but I may need some help when I get to that point.

    <p>Home page</p>
    <h1>
        I see my home page looking somewhat similar to the top half of what we've been doing for the rafting site.  The next
        thing that I see there being is the links the the other two pages where I can go more into detail about those things.
        I think the home page will mostly be a general overview of 3D modeling and I will have a fiew photos of what I have
        personaly done.  I could grab a fiew photo's of what others have done, but I don't feel cofortable with that without
        tallking to them first.  I think that I might be able to also find a way to build a third page, time pending, to do 
        a page about painting models.  I'm hesatint to do this, simply because I don't know if I have the time to do it, but
        I think that this could be a good addition to the website.
    </h1>
    <p>Modeling Page</p>
    <h1>
        This will proably be the page that I spend the most time on, simply because this is what I plan on focussing on for the 
        website.  This page will have some descriptions of how to go about modeling and some of the basic ideas behind it.  I 
        also will be planning on giving some examples of various modeling sites and links to the sites if possible.  I plan on 
        showing off what I've done with my modeling so far.
    </h1>
    <p>Particles page</p>
    <h1>
        This is the page I think I can have some of the most fun with, but this can also take some time.  I plan to go into detail
        about how particles work and give some idea as to what you can do with them.  As this is my weekest point when it comes to
        these things, I'm not sure just how much information I can get onto it.  As for what I can show on this page I have some
        projects that I've worked on in the past (mostly hack week).  And I can show off these pretty esaly.  The one thing I'm 
        not completly sure on how to embed a video on the site.  If I can get some help on that I think I can put this over the top.
    </h1>
    <p>Painting</p>
    <h1>
        This is a page I'm a little hesatint to build simply because I don't know if I'm going to have the time.  But if I do have
        the time this can be a fun page.  the idea behind painting is to make your things look good.  This can be done in modeling
        ,and I will go over that part either here or in the modeling section, but painting is a lot of fun to do and I do have a 
        few things I can show off about it.
