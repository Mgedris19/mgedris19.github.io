        What to do next:
    </h1>
    <p>
        Alright so you can do some modeling and maybe you’re feeling comfortable with it.  But you might
        be having the feeling of wanting to take it further.  There are a few other places you can go.
    </p>
    <h1>UV Mapping:</h1>
    <p>
        One of the easiest things to do, (because it’s built into most engines) is what is called uv mapping.  
        This is how it would work.  On each of your shapes there are faces.  This is what you typically are grabbing when 
        you want to move pieces of it around.  But with uv mapping this is what becomes the part of the object that looks 
        painted.  To do this open up the UV mapping editor and a small window will pop out.  You do have to import the image
        you want to map into it, here is a link that describes it a little bit better.  Now you just have to move the faces 
        of the object to be located where you want them.  The movement is similar to how you would move and interact with the
        faces outside of the uv editor.

    <p>
        If you can’t find a way to map the object there is another option to paint it, and that is painting it.  
        There are a handful of 3D painters out there and really you just have to know where to look.  I believe that 
        Adobe does have a free option for students to use, though I am not sure of the process myself.  The idea behind 
        it would be to take the model into the painting engine and then paint it.  The difficult part about this is 
        getting it so the faces are all aligned and not overlapped, unless you want some of the faces to look the same, 
        in which case then by all means lighten your workload.  To do this you need to go into the UV editor (as described 
        above) and move the faces around so they aren’t touching any of the faces.  The other big thing to note about this 
        is you shouldn’t have the faces overlapping on a grid line.  Reason for this being when you go to paint it, the 
        file won’t export correctly.

        Getting the model into the painting engine:
    </h1>
    <p>
        For the most part, this is pretty simple.  All you need to do is go to the top left corner(usually) and go 
        to file.  Look down until you find a button that says export.  Choose that option and then select a place for 
        it to be exported.  Go into the painting software and choose open, and select your model that you want to paint.  
        One last thing, when exporting from Maya it usually is an fbx file that you end up exporting so make sure to select 
        that option.
